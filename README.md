# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Understand how other campaigns performed based on launch date and goal. 

### Purpose
Use data to drive insight into campaign outcomes to increase campaign success. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Pivot table in worksheet labeled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date":

Line chart showing number of successful, failed, or canceled projects by month:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Data table in worksheet labeled "Outcome Based Goals":

Line chart showing goal-amount ranges on the xaxis and percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects on the yaxis:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

This analysis required unix date conversion, many functions (like IF, COUNTIFS and ROUND), some simple equations and pivot tables. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  1. The month of July nets the highest total successful theater outcomes
  2. September, October, November and December have the smallest gap between successful and failed theater outcomes

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
